# IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

## Objective
This project aims to utilize a variety of machine learning models, feature sets, and preprocessing techniques to determine the optimal hyperparameters for sentiment prediction in movie reviews. The dataset was generated by scraping IMDb movie reviews and manually labeling sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Method
We collected 1000 IMDb movie reviews through web scraping using BeautifulSoup and then manually categorized them by sentiment. After cleaning and tokenizing the reviews, we applied lemmatization and Snowball stemming. Four vectorization techniques, including Bag of Words, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), bi-grams, and a combination of these, were explored. We assessed the performance of Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest Classifier models to identify the most accurate sentiment classification method. We then applied the best model to user reviews and evaluated misclassifications.

## Results
Our findings indicated that the choice between lemmatization and Snowball stemming had minimal impact on model performance. Among vectorization techniques, TF-IDF consistently outperformed Bag of Words, bi-grams, and their combination. The Naive Bayes model on TF-IDF vectors achieved the highest F1-score of 0.705 across the three models.

## Conclusion
This study underscores the significance of hyperparameter tuning, model selection, and feature set choice, with TF-IDF emerging as the superior feature set. We explored diverse preprocessing and vectorization techniques to establish an optimal approach for movie review sentiment analysis. The results highlight Naive Bayes as the top-performing and computationally efficient model. Additionally, the study observed that a dataset of 1000 samples poses limitations in achieving precise results, as minor adjustments in hyperparameters or the model seed can significantly influence accuracy. The choice between stemming and lemmatization had little impact on model performance. Overall, this research provides valuable insights for future sentiment analysis in movie-related text data.
